# what do I want the function to do?

# i want the led's to reflect the status of a few things
# is the video controler running
# is the audio controler running
# there are a few different states that the detectors could be in that would be their own state

# i feel like the most direct way to do this
# would be to for each led, have it send messages to mesure states and set itself
